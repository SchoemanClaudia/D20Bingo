# D20 Bingo

D20 Bingo is a game of chance, with a twist on the classic bingo. Combining bingo mechanics with the unpredictability of a 20 sided die, the user will race against the clock in this solo adventure. The goal is to complete a pattern on a 4x4 game card, with each number determined by the roll of a D20.
